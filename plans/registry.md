# cargo-cleanme Active Planning Registry

This file is the compact control surface for active planning. Detailed requirements live in canonical documents, accepted ADRs, the subsystem roadmap, implementation plans, and closure records.

Canonical direction:

- plans/000-long-term-specification.md
- plans/001-terminology-and-domain-model.md
- plans/002-long-term-roadmap.md
- plans/003-planning-process.md

Accepted architecture decisions:

- plans/adr/001-workspace-output-ownership-and-cleanup-authorization.md
- plans/adr/002-adaptive-routine-full-discovery-state.md

## Status vocabulary

- proposed — direction exists but is not implementation-ready.
- ready — dependencies/contracts are satisfied.
- active — implementation is in progress.
- blocked — a named dependency/evidence requirement prevents progress.
- closing — implementation landed and closure evidence is being gathered.
- closed — closure record accepted.
- conditionally closed — substantial work landed but named evidence remains.
- superseded — replaced by a newer plan.
- archived — retained for traceability only.

## Active subsystem roadmaps

| Subsystem | Status | Roadmap | Current milestone | Dependencies / blockers |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Artifact discovery and cleanup | active | plans/subsystems/artifact-discovery-cleanup-roadmap.md | Phase 10 distribution (deferred) | M008A/M008B are closed, M008C conditionally closed, and M008D closed. No later registered plan is eligible; Phase 10 distribution remains deferred. |

| Artifact discovery and cleanup | M006E adaptive Routine/Full discovery + state/config UX | **closed** | plans/implementation/artifact-discovery-cleanup/006e-adaptive-routine-full-discovery-state.md | Historical closure: plans/closure/artifact-discovery-cleanup/006e-status.md. Corrective closure: plans/closure/artifact-discovery-cleanup/c005-status.md; localized uncertainty now reconciles conservatively and publishes a useful generation. |
| Artifact discovery and cleanup | M006E old scope/latency decision | **superseded** | plans/implementation/artifact-discovery-cleanup/006e-global-scan-scope-and-latency-policy.md | Replaced by ADR 002 and the adaptive-discovery M006E plan. |
| Artifact discovery and cleanup | M006F exhaustive traversal hot-path qualification | **closed** | plans/implementation/artifact-discovery-cleanup/006f-exhaustive-traversal-hot-path-qualification.md | Closure: plans/closure/artifact-discovery-cleanup/006f-status.md. Hosted Linux/macOS/Windows and Rust 1.89 CI passed in run 37139155641. |
| Artifact discovery and cleanup | M007 learned/full cleanup orchestration | **closed** | plans/implementation/artifact-discovery-cleanup/007-learned-full-cleanup-orchestration.md | Corrective closure: plans/closure/artifact-discovery-cleanup/c006-status.md. Combined selected-root proof, known/full orchestration, mode parity, zero-clean simulation, and platform/MSRV gates pass. Historical blocked record is unchanged. |
| Artifact discovery and cleanup | C005 uncertainty-aware state reconciliation + config/edit hardening | **closed** | plans/implementation/artifact-discovery-cleanup/c005-uncertainty-aware-state-reconciliation-and-config-edit-hardening.md | Closure: plans/closure/artifact-discovery-cleanup/c005-status.md. Localized Full uncertainty reconciles conservatively; isolated real Full published schema 2; hosted platform/MSRV gates pass. |
| Artifact discovery and cleanup | C006 combined-root cleanup ownership universe | **closed** | plans/implementation/artifact-discovery-cleanup/c006-combined-root-cleanup-ownership-universe.md | Closure: plans/closure/artifact-discovery-cleanup/c006-status.md. Combined discovery/coverage/ownership proof and final per-candidate refresh pass hosted platform/MSRV gates. |
| Artifact discovery and cleanup | C007 discovery-state recovery + post-M007 planning cleanup | **closed** | plans/implementation/artifact-discovery-cleanup/c007-discovery-state-recovery-and-post-m007-planning-cleanup.md | Closure: plans/closure/artifact-discovery-cleanup/c007-status.md. Hosted platform/MSRV run 37152008602 passed. |
| Artifact discovery and cleanup | M008A workspace selective cleanup policy | **closed** | plans/implementation/artifact-discovery-cleanup/008a-workspace-selective-cleanup-policy.md | Closure: plans/closure/artifact-discovery-cleanup/008a-status.md. Fresh policy races, excluded shared owner, all-mode zero-spawn assertions, Rust 1.89, and hosted platform CI passed. |
| Artifact discovery and cleanup | M008B machine-readable reporting + automation contract | **closed** | plans/implementation/artifact-discovery-cleanup/008b-machine-readable-reporting-and-automation-contract.md | Closure: plans/closure/artifact-discovery-cleanup/008b-status.md. Typed subreason codes, selector/report DTOs, unattended fake-Cargo Execute, JSON scope metadata, Rust 1.89, and hosted CI passed. |
| Artifact discovery and cleanup | M008C Cargo profile/package selective cleanup qualification | **conditionally closed** | plans/implementation/artifact-discovery-cleanup/008c-cargo-profile-package-selective-cleanup-qualification.md | Closure: plans/closure/artifact-discovery-cleanup/008c-status.md. Real-Cargo matrix enables Cargo profile selection for qualified versions; package selection remains typed unsupported due shared-output and configured-target behavior. |
| Artifact discovery and cleanup | M008D Cargo package-selector qualification and enablement | **closed** | plans/implementation/artifact-discovery-cleanup/008d-cargo-package-selector-qualification-and-enablement.md | Closure: plans/closure/artifact-discovery-cleanup/008d-status.md. Exact Cargo 1.98.1/1.99.0 behavior, package identity validation, unknown-version failure, and hosted platform/MSRV gates pass. |

## Current handoff

C007 and M008A/M008B are closed. M008C is conditionally closed: Cargo profile cleanup is enabled with unknown selector-byte accounting. M008D is closed; package cleanup is enabled for the exact qualified Cargo releases with unknown selector-byte accounting. No subsequent implementation handoff is ready; Phase 10 distribution remains deferred.

Milestone sequence:

~~~text
M001-M005 + C001-C004 -> closed
M006A/C/D historical conditional evidence -> retained
M006B/M006E/M006F -> closed
C005 -> closed
C006 -> closed
M007 -> closed by C006
C007 discovery-state recovery + post-M007 planning cleanup -> closed
M008A workspace selective cleanup policy -> closed
M008B machine-readable reporting/automation contract -> closed
M008C Cargo profile/package selective cleanup -> conditionally closed; profile enabled, package deferred
M008D Cargo package selector -> closed
~~~

Phase 9 planning is complete. M008D is closed. Distribution remains deferred to Phase 10 and is not unblocked by M008D.

### Current destructive safety boundary

- Cargo resolves workspace/output configuration; cargo-cleanme does not infer unresolved output paths.
- Every Cargo manifest discovered under the selected cleanup root set must be authoritatively covered before any Cargo clean command may run.
- Unresolved ownership participants block Preview, Simulate, and Execute for the complete selected-root scope.
- The destructive unit is one workspace CleanupUnit over its complete OutputSet.
- Every affected physical group must be PrivateBounded, authorized, inactive, non-symlink, marker-qualified, and stable under fresh complete combined ownership-graph revalidation.
- cleanup.allowed_output_roots never manufactures ownership proof.
- --dryrun remains zero-clean and shares the same completeness/final-proof gates as Execute.
- --stats is the qualification/debug surface.
