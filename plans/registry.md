Planning framework baseline: 97dee9fa64868534cedf3a9310e7160335a91be2
M006 implementation baseline: 47574fa8a087ac2f9111e29821c23b13657e7bbe

## Status vocabulary

- proposed — direction exists but is not implementation-ready.
- ready — dependencies/contracts are satisfied.
- active — implementation is in progress.
- blocked — a named dependency/evidence requirement prevents progress.
- closing — implementation landed and closure evidence is being gathered.
- closed — closure record accepted.
- conditionally closed — substantial work landed but named evidence remains.
- superseded — replaced by a newer plan.
- archived — retained for traceability only.

## Active subsystem roadmaps

| Subsystem | Status | Roadmap | Current milestone | Dependencies / blockers |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Artifact discovery and cleanup | active | plans/subsystems/artifact-discovery-cleanup-roadmap.md | M006 performance hardening | M006A, M006C, and M006D are conditionally closed with named scan qualification misses; M006B is closed. Proposed M006E needs an explicit scope-versus-latency policy decision. M005 remains closed/green. |

| Artifact discovery and cleanup | M006E global scan scope and latency policy | **proposed** | plans/implementation/artifact-discovery-cleanup/006e-global-scan-scope-and-latency-policy.md | Awaiting explicit product decision; current full-scope behavior and cleanup safety remain unchanged. |

## Immediate handoff

M006A, M006C, and M006D have been implemented and conditionally closed with measured qualification misses; M006B is closed after that disposition and passed hosted Linux/macOS/Windows and Rust 1.89 CI. M006E is proposed to resolve the scope-versus-latency policy decision.

Expected order:

~~~text
M001-M005 + C001-C004 -> closed
M006A global discovery/pruning/path normalization -> conditionally closed (macOS scan >120 s)
M006B cleanup-proof resolution efficiency -> closed
M006C traversal throughput without scope narrowing -> conditionally closed (macOS scan >120 s)
M006D global scan completion qualification -> conditionally closed (exact native scan remains over 120 s)
M006E global scan scope and latency policy -> proposed (awaiting explicit decision)
M006 performance hardening -> remains active until global scan throughput is qualified
~~~

M006A owns the >120 s no-argument scan, global-only OS/tool-managed pruning, one-pool multi-root discovery, and the macOS member-source-root/output-exclusion identity mismatch. M006A's 120-second acceptance criterion remains unmet; `/Users` dominated the measured post-policy traversal.

M006B owns cleanup proof subprocess cost. It removes redundant final-proof locate-project calls and adds bounded parallel metadata refresh after measurement. It MUST NOT reuse one stale ownership-universe snapshot across destructive candidates.

M005 destructive release qualification remains restored and is not blocked by M006; M006 is performance hardening, not a safety prerequisite.

### Current destructive safety boundary

- Cargo resolves workspace/output configuration; cargo-cleanme does not infer unresolved output paths.
- Every Cargo manifest discovered under clean ROOT must be authoritatively covered before any Cargo clean command may run.
- Unresolved ownership participants block Preview, Simulate, and Execute for the entire clean scope.
- The destructive unit is one workspace CleanupUnit over its complete OutputSet.
- Every affected physical group must be PrivateBounded, authorized, inactive, non-symlink, marker-qualified, and stable under fresh complete ownership-graph revalidation.
- cleanup.allowed_output_roots never manufactures ownership proof.
- --dryrun remains zero-clean and shares the same completeness/final-proof gates as Execute.
- --stats is the qualification/debug surface.
