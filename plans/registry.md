# cargo-cleanme Active Planning Registry

This file is the compact control surface for active planning. Detailed requirements live in canonical documents, accepted ADRs, the subsystem roadmap, implementation plans, and closure records.

Canonical direction:

- plans/000-long-term-specification.md
- plans/001-terminology-and-domain-model.md
- plans/002-long-term-roadmap.md
- plans/003-planning-process.md

Accepted architecture decisions:

- plans/adr/001-workspace-output-ownership-and-cleanup-authorization.md

Planning framework baseline: 97dee9fa64868534cedf3a9310e7160335a91be2
Current repository planning baseline: 819f71cd50bebb3b68ae54ef22e6951f08edcbbe

## Status vocabulary

- proposed — direction exists but is not implementation-ready.
- ready — dependencies/contracts are satisfied.
- active — implementation is in progress.
- blocked — a named dependency/evidence requirement prevents progress.
- closing — implementation landed and closure evidence is being gathered.
- closed — closure record accepted.
- conditionally closed — substantial work landed but named evidence remains.
- superseded — replaced by a newer plan.
- archived — retained for traceability only.

## Active subsystem roadmaps

| Subsystem | Status | Roadmap | Current milestone | Dependencies / blockers |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Artifact discovery and cleanup | active | plans/subsystems/artifact-discovery-cleanup-roadmap.md | M005 release qualification restored | C004 closed; deferred performance/canonicalization items remain unclaimed follow-up candidates. |

M005 destructive release qualification is restored. |

## Immediate handoff

Implement C004.

Expected order:

~~~text
M001-M004 -> closed
C001 -> closed
ADR 001 -> accepted
M005A -> closed
M005B -> historically closed
C002 -> historically closed
C003 -> historically closed
C004 complete discovered-manifest ownership coverage -> closed
M005 destructive release qualification -> restored after C004 closure
~~~

Post-C003 audit finding: the final ownership graph contained every successfully resolved workspace, but a discovered Cargo manifest that never resolves could disappear from the ownership universe. C004 now retains manifest-resolution coverage and blocks all cleanup modes while any discovered ownership participant remains unresolved. The M005 destructive-release blocker is closed.

Separate deferred lines: C003's measured O(N²) cleanup-proof refresh cost, macOS member-source-root canonicalization/pruning inefficiency, and generic no-argument scan performance.

### M005 safety boundary after C004 planning

- Cargo resolves workspace/output configuration; cargo-cleanme does not infer unresolved output paths.
- Every Cargo manifest discovered under clean ROOT must be authoritatively covered by a resolved workspace before any Cargo clean command may run.
- Unresolved ownership participants block Preview, Simulate, and Execute for the entire clean scope.
- The destructive unit remains one workspace CleanupUnit over its complete OutputSet.
- Every affected physical group must be PrivateBounded, authorized, inactive, non-symlink, marker-qualified, and stable under C003 final graph revalidation.
- cleanup.allowed_output_roots never manufactures ownership proof.
- --dryrun remains zero-clean and shares the same completeness and final-proof gates as Execute.
- --stats remains the qualification/debug surface.
