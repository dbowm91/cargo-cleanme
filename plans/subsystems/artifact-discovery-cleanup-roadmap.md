# Artifact Discovery and Cleanup Roadmap

Status: active

Repository audit baseline: 54dfc5440a8bca51b768f59df2d16ba5d2b3b242

## 1. Purpose and ownership boundary

This workstream owns Cargo project discovery, search-scope policy, activity classification, artifact sizing/reporting, and—only after the read-only boundary closes—safe Cargo-mediated cleanup.

It does not own Cargo global cache GC, arbitrary build-system caches, a general disk-usage browser, filesystem indexing, Git repository management, background watchers, or a general-purpose deletion engine.

## 2. Initial invariants

- V0.1 is read-only.
- No symlink directory is followed.
- scan_start_time is captured once.
- default recency_seconds is 300.
- filesystem mtimes, not Git commit history, determine recent activity.
- recent source activity and recent target activity both protect a project.
- future timestamps protect a project.
- explicit scan scope supersedes user ignore/unignore search filters.
- unignore paths can remain reachable through an otherwise ignored ancestor.
- target sizing does not happen during the broad discovery pass.
- filesystem errors never silently turn uncertain candidates into eligible results.
- output ordering is deterministic.
- internal traversal types do not leak into the domain/CLI model.
- cleanup is not introduced before read-only closure.

## 3. Current-state evidence

At the audit baseline the repository contains only README.md and no Rust implementation.

Relevant current ecosystem evidence:

1. dua-core 4.1.0 is a released crate exposing parallel work-stealing walks, descent predicates, non-following symlinks, errors as iterator items, cancellation, and stream_roots for a fixed pool shared by newly submitted roots.

2. filesize 0.2 exposes platform-aware on-disk sizing. Unix can use metadata blocks directly; Windows uses GetCompressedFileSizeW.

3. current Cargo supports both build.target-dir and build.build-dir. The latter can differ from target-dir, so arbitrary configured output cannot safely be folded into the first conventional-target release.

4. existing tools such as Kondo and cargo-clean-all validate the usefulness of recursive Cargo artifact discovery, but cargo-cleanme intentionally defines activity from project + build filesystem state and keeps destructive cleanup out of the initial release.

The eventual cleanup service is a later consumer of freshly revalidated candidates; it is not part of this initial architecture slice.

## 6. Milestone M001 — Foundation, CLI, config, and domain contracts

Status: ready.

Primary class: infrastructure / invariant.

Plan:

- plans/implementation/artifact-discovery-cleanup/001-foundation-cli-config-and-domain-model.md

Outcome:

- establish the Cargo package and module boundaries;
- support cargo-cleanme and cargo cleanme entry points;
- define no-argument scan behavior;
- load/validate config.toml with 300-second default;
- define explicit scan-scope precedence;
- define typed domain results and diagnostics;
- establish test/CI/MSRV gates;
- ensure no destructive code path exists.

## 7. Milestone M002 — Fast project discovery and scope filters

Status: blocked on M001 closure.

Primary class: infrastructure / capability.

Plan:

- plans/implementation/artifact-discovery-cleanup/002-fast-project-discovery-and-scope-filters.md

Outcome:

- integrate a replaceable dua-core-backed traversal engine;
- enumerate global/explicit roots;
- implement ignore glob and exact unignore semantics;
- preserve unignore ancestry;
- discover Cargo.toml + direct real target pairs;
- prune target and VCS trees;
- refuse symlink targets and symlink traversal;
- expose bounded diagnostics without target sizing.

## 8. Milestone M003 — Activity, size analysis, and read-only reporting

Status: blocked on M002 closure.

Primary class: capability / invariant.

Plan:

- plans/implementation/artifact-discovery-cleanup/003-activity-size-analysis-and-read-only-reporting.md

Outcome:

- protect recently edited or recently built projects;
- short-circuit source activity;
- compute target activity and allocated/on-disk size;
- reject uncertain candidates;
- render deterministic size-descending output and totals;
- qualify the whole read-only pipeline on Linux/macOS/Windows;
- collect representative performance evidence.

M003 is the first product-capability closure boundary.

## 9. Milestone M004 — Revalidated cleanup execution

Status: deferred. Do not write or implement the handoff until M003 closes and read-only behavior has been field-qualified.

Expected direction:

- explicit destructive subcommand;
- revalidation immediately before each clean;
- cargo clean invocation bound to intended manifest/output ownership;
- dry-run/confirmation policy;
- per-project result isolation;
- cancellation/process handling;
- post-clean measurement;
- actual recovered-byte report.

Conventional local target ownership is the first cleanup target. External/shared target-dir/build-dir remains out of scope.

## 10. Milestone M005 — Redirected/shared output

Status: deferred.

Expected direction:

- resolve Cargo config hierarchy safely;
- model final target-dir and intermediate build-dir separately;
- detect/shared ownership;
- refuse destructive ambiguity;
- avoid duplicate reporting for one physical shared directory.

This milestone may require an ADR once M004 evidence exists.

## 11. Cross-cutting reliability concerns

### Races

A filesystem can change during any scan. V0.1 is inventory only, so it records a coherent best-effort observation around a fixed cutoff. Future cleanup MUST revalidate and cannot trust stale eligibility.

### Clock behavior

Wall-clock modification times can be skewed. Future mtimes are active. An inability to compare required timestamps safely disqualifies that candidate.

### Permissions

Permission errors outside a candidate are diagnostic. Permission/metadata failures inside a candidate disqualify it when they prevent reliable activity or size analysis.

### Parallelism

Parallel traversal must not change eligibility, ordering, or diagnostic classification. Final results are sorted after analysis.

### Memory

The scanner should stream discovery and analysis records rather than materialize a full machine tree.

## 12. Verification direction

Each milestone uses fixture-first tests plus platform CI.

Critical fixtures include:

- empty tree;
- plain Cargo project without target;
- empty target;
- inactive target;
- recent source edit;
- recent target edit;
- future mtime;
- workspace root/member;
- nested independent repository;
- target symlink;
- ignored tree;
- ignored tree with re-included descendant;
- explicit root bypassing filters;
- permission-denied subtree where platform test support permits;
- disappearing file during traversal;
- non-UTF-8 path on Unix;
- large wide/deep target tree.

## 13. Performance direction

M002/M003 should record benchmark-style comparisons, but no hardware-specific wall-clock promise is canonical.

The implementation should specifically verify:

- pruning happens before unnecessary target traversal;
- recent source activity can stop project analysis before sizing;
- candidate targets can share one bounded worker pool;
- increasing candidate count does not spawn unbounded worker pools;
- memory grows with active analysis state, not total discovered filesystem entries.

## 14. Completion definition

The initial workstream reaches its first closure boundary when M001-M003 are closed with evidence that cargo cleanme safely inventories inactive conventional Cargo target directories across supported platforms, obeys root/filter precedence, produces trustworthy deterministic size output, and has no destructive execution path.
